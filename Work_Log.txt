Please describe when you worked and what you got done:

4/18/16
@Vineet Sepaha
	Worked on the frame.c and frame.h file.
	Finished implementing a couple of functions, and commented on what the 
functions are used to do.

=======
4/18/16
@Kevin Wu
	- Worked on page.c and page.h files.
	- Added functions to initialize, destroy, and hash page tables
	- Corresponding comments have been added 
=======

4/19/16
@Kevin Wu
	- Continued work on page.c file
	- Added the following functions:
		a) compare hash entries
		b) check if page is loaded
		c) load page
		d) load swap
		e) load file
	- Corresponding comments have been added

	- Implementation near completion for page.c. page.h needs work done
=======
4/20/16
@Prit Modi
	- Worked on swap.h and swap.c
	- Added structs
	- Implemented start_swap
	
=======	
4/21/16
@Vineet Sepaha
	Worked on exception.c and syscall.h
	There are errors in userprog because we do not have the complete versions
of page.c, page.h, swap.c and swap.h.

=======
4/22/16
@Kevin Wu
	- Completed page.c and page.h
		- Note: Additional changes will still be needed as swap.c and swap.h are not yet implemented
	- Added the following functions:
		a) add file to page table
		b) map memory to page table
		c) growth of stack
	- NOTE: there is a difference between "suppl_page_tbl_ent" and "suppl_page_table"
	- Corresponding comments have been added
	
=======
4/23/16
@Vineet Sepaha
	Worked on the compatibilty between mine and and kevin's implementation.
	Working on process.c to see where to implement certain functions.
	Also added a Makefile.build which needs to replace the Makefile.build in the pintos/src directory.
	
@Prit Modi
	- Worked on swap.h and swap.c
	- Implemented swap_in
=======
4/24/16
@Vineet Sepaha
	Multiple bug fixes in frame.c 
	Added syscall.c to userprog and made an edit
	Edited syscall.h 
	Revealed many errors in page.c

=======
4/25/16
@Kevin Wu
	- Revised page.c and page.h due to new found errors
	- errors are still present...

=======
4/26/16
@Kevin Wu
	- Continued revising page.c and page.h
	- Further revision is needed...
	- Will make changes to thread.h in the future
	
@Prit Modi
	- Continued working on swap.h and swap.c
	- Implemented swap_out
	
=======
4/28/16
@Prit Modi
	- Continued revising swap.c and swap.h
	- Troubleshooting and fixing errors on the go

=======
4/30/16
@Kevin Wu
	- Revisions made to page.c and page.h
	- Added additional lines to /src/userprog/process.c
	- Added additional lines to /src/threads/thread.h
	- Revisions made to syscall.c
	- Additional lines added to syscall.h
	
@Prit Modi
	- Finished working on swap.c and swap.h
	- No compiling errors 
	******************************************************
	- A LOT of work is needed to be done on syscall.c
		- I don't wanna do it :<
		- syscalls mmap and munmap need to be added in
		- mmap and munmap functions need to be declared...
		- existing syscalls need to be redefined...
		- For NOW, added basic declarations to syscall.c
	- Will do this portion if no one else is willing
	******************************************************

	UPDATE:
		- sycalls mmap and munmap added to syscall handler
		- functions mmap and munmap have been declared
		- corresponding appropriate names have been implemented

	TO DO:
		- existing syscalls need to be redefined
		- the names of some functions are mismatched...

	- Errors are still persistent
		- Personally, I don't believe we are going to be able to get this project to even compile...
