4/5/2016
- We need to go through the design document and go through the different 
parts we need to do to complete the project.
- Next time that we meet, we should have read up on the different aspects
of the project to get an idea about what we are working on.

4/7/2016
- We will each divide up the project so we know who will work on which part.
- Next time that we meet, we should have a general idea about what we have to 
do for each of our parts for the project.
- Missing group member Prit for this meeting

4/11/2016 (Dont really need to meet unless necessary)
- We should each have started to implement our part of the project.
- Next time we will discuss what each member of the group is working on and
if there are any problems which we need to deal with in the implementation.
- Have a list of questions regarding the project to be asked during lecture.

4/12/2016
- Most of the questions left for this project should've been discussed 
and answered by IP during class time.
- Division of labor clarified (LOOKING AT YOU PRIT)
- Implementation should have begun and each member should have gotten
inspiration (WILSONRYANTIM)

4/14/2016
- We have the parts of the projects divided, to reiterate:
Kevin - page.c and page.h
Prit - swap.c and swap.h
Vineet - frame.c and frame.h
- If anyone plans on using inspiration for their part, you should comment
all of the code to understand the theory and change all of the variable names.
- For the next time we meet, we should each have some portion of our work done
and be able to explain it.
- Also as you do work, update it on the file called 'Work Log.txt'

4/18/2016
- Have a short discussion on what each group member worked on for the project
- Please remember to update the work log every time you work on the project, also
MAKE SURE TO WORK on the project
- For the next time we meet, you MUST have some work to show and talk about.
- If you do not have any work done, there is no reason for you to attend the meeting.
